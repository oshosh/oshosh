> **Contributor to `react-day-picker`**, a lightweight and customizable date selection library for React.
> 
> Widely adopted and used as the underlying engine for the **Calendar component in `shadcn/ui`** — providing core date logic while the UI layer is styled through the shadcn system.

**Notable Contribution:**  
I identified and reported a bug related to nested `Date[]` matchers not being applied correctly in `react-day-picker`.  
After analyzing the cause, I proposed the correct handling approach in the issue discussion, and my solution was adopted and merged by the maintainer:

- Issue: https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/2864  
- PR reflecting my solution: https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/2865
